## Philosophy

> I like to be creative and think outside the box to find new and unexpected solutions.

## AI Coding

I mostly use ChatGPT Codex for AI coding. Its context window is huge and rarely exhausted, and the value for money is excellent. It also works well for running two (or more) agents in parallel on the same project.
